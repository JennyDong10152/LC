#1: node 定位不准确
#19， 2095

Find Middle Element
initialize fast = slow = head 
    => slow points to the second of the two middle nodes if length is even
    => slow points to the middle node if length is odd

initialize fast = head.next 
    => slow points to the first of the two middle nodes if length is even
    => slow points to the middle node if length is odd

logistic: fast 在initialize的时候往后一位，iteration少一次，slow移动少一次
在原有template上稍作修改，少循环/多循环一个就能定位到prev/next node
#2095： if fast=fast.next.next at initialization, slow points to the node before middle if length is odd, 
        before the second middle node if length is even


#2: sanity check: handle every prev/next between modified nodes 
set node.next = None to make lists independent/avoid cycle
    ex. 86: set secondTail.next (last node) = None
